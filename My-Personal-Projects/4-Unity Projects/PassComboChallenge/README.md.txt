# PassComboChallenge

**PassComboChallenge** is a fast-paced, skill-based game built in Unity that challenges players to master a series of precise button combinations under pressure. It tests memory, reflexes, and pattern recognition through a dynamic combo system with escalating difficulty.

## Key Features

- Combo-Based Gameplay: Players must quickly input sequences of keys to score points and keep the challenge going.
- Time Pressure Mechanic: Each combo must be completed within a time limit that gets shorter as levels progress.
- Minimal UI with Focused UX: Clean, intuitive interface so the user can focus on mastering combos.
- Audio Feedback System: Real-time sound effects based on player performance (correct/miss/bonus).
- Modular Code Architecture: Organized folder structure with Core, Gameplay, UI, and Audio scripts for better scalability and maintainability.

## What We've Done

- Designed and implemented the core game loop and input system.
- Developed the combo logic using tap or click.
- Integrated responsive UI elements to display input sequences and feedback.
- Refactored scripts into a clean folder structure: `Scripts/Core`, `Scripts/Gameplay`, and `Scripts/UI`.
- Added sound feedback using the Unity Audio system.
- Setup project for future scalability — ready to extend with features like leaderboards or multiplayer.
